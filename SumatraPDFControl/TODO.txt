TODO (Version 1.3.1):

Throw exception on error loading document
Review control inherited properties / events to hide those are not used and implement others* 
Analyze and implement possible to send other messages from SumatraPDF Canvas WndProc to SumatraPDFControl 		 
  - Page: first, previous, next, last 
  - Select All
  - Others?
Special keys events 
  - Block WM_SYSCHAR message (handled by FrameOnSysChar on SumatraPDF.cpp) because ALT+Space can give user control of current plugin window 
  - Treat ALT key
LastPage get property
Global Config - auto update, etc
Documentation
  - Include reference to SumatraPDFControlTest in documentation
    * Alter it to download SumatraPDF.exe automatically from Nuget.Org if necessary
  - Include GPLv3 licence file and comments in source code
Do a revision in GEDVISA PDFXChange used properties
   
TODO (Future versions):

Print:
 - Events: onPrint, onPrintEnd
 - Methods: AbortPrint, MayCloseWindow
 - Direct Print method
 
Toc:
  - ContextMenu SumatraPDFControl for toc - Create a property for tocContextMenu
  
Others:
  - Create function to get Canvas, Toc and toolbar positions in Frame position to use by mouse click events 		 
  - Page rotation event is more complicated to implement because current Window information (WindowInfo*) does not exists in DisplayModel sumatrapdf object. 
    So its impossible to send PluginHostCallBack message without replicate this call in all points of source code calling method DisplayModel::RotateBy.
  - Implement FileOpened and StartupFinished events
