Print:
 - Events: onPrint, onPrintEnd
 - Methods: AbortPrint, MayCloseWindow
 - Direct Print method
 
Toc:
  - ContextMenu SumatraPDFControl for toc - Create a property for tocContextMenu
  
Others:
  - Create function to get Canvas, Toc and toolbar positions in Frame position to use by mouse click events 		 
  - Page rotation event is more complicated to implement because current Window information (WindowInfo*) does not exists in DisplayModel sumatrapdf object. 
    So its impossible to send PluginHostCallBack message without replicate this call in all points of source code calling method DisplayModel::RotateBy.
  - Implement FileOpened and StartupFinished events
